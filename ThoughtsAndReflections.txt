Thoughts and reflections by Conan Hollands

I overdelivered on the specification, creating an object relations mapping framework which allowed for two way data transfers between the program and the database. 

I am a stickler for good code so went over any proposed changes to the program. 

I wanted to create Java objects from database table data. Methods are not first class objects in java, so this would require
a design pattern that I did not think I had time to implement.

I did manage to implement generics for methods which returned ArrayLists of objects, and methods which print object data.

I feel that while the code works, and has input validation for practically everything [so no bugs as far as I am aware], it could nonetheless have been
accomplished in half the lines of code.
