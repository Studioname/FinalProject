Theatre-goers with disabilities:

"...only 6% of customers identified as having a disability... The proportion was virtually the same outside London (with
7% in the subsidised and 8% in the commercial sector)... General population data for 2014 shows that 16% of
working age adults and 45% of adults over State Pension age are disabled... disabled people remain significantly less likely
to participate in cultural, leisure and sporting activities than non-disabled people” Consultees reported that, in addressing these
challenges... existing mechanisms ... and use of new technology – are still not frequently used..."

Assertion: Disabled people are under-represented among theatre-goers
Proposed solution: Digital presence increases accessibility, allowing disabled people to more easily engage with the theatre

Social media allows theatre-goers to engage with the theatre outside of performances:

"... In 2010, Gardner spoke of the need for theatres to “[use] social
media properly – not just for free advertising”... [she pointed] to a survey by SOLT which showed that 65%
of people felt that social media helped them decide whether to go to the theatre,
but suggested that “on the whole, theatre seems to be waking up rather slowly” to this opportunity..."

Based on this assertion, we believe expanding the application into a web application and pairing it with a social media presence will increase interest in theatre
